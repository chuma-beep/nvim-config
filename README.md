# 💤 My LazyVim Config

This is my personal [LazyVim](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) setup.

### 🔧 Purpose

- ⚙️ Optimized for:
  - **Web development** (HTML, CSS, JS/TS)
  - **Machine learning** (Python, Jupyter)
  - **Systems programming** (C)

### 📦 Features (WIP)

- Pre-configured LSPs, formatters, and linters
- Smooth Git integration, fuzzy finder, and keymaps
- Minimal, fast, and extensible

### 🧠 Notes

- Refer to the [LazyVim docs](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) for setup.
- I’ll continue updating and improving this config as my workflow evolves.
